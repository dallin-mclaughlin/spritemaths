# About spritemaths Laravel and Vue version

This is a second version of [spritemaths](https://spritemaths.com). If you wish to try it in the browser: username: nillad12@gmail.com, password: dallin. It includes php, vue and mysql.
I really liked how easy vue was to make the UI impressive and interactive. It worked well with Mathlive even since Mathlive's recent updates. Although I did have to rewrite the code in some parts to make sure Mathlive was still compatible.

## Code used from outside libraries

-   [Mathlive](https://cortexjs.io/) for math input fields and math display candy.
-   [php math parser](https://github.com/mossadal/math-parser).
-   [function plotter](http://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/) for javascript and typescript
