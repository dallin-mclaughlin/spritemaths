# About spritemaths Laravel and Vue version

This is a second version of [spritemaths](https://spritemaths.com). If you wish to try it in the browser: username: nillad12@gmail.com, password: dallin. It includes php, vue and mysql.
I really liked how easy vue was to use to make the UI impressive and interactive. It also worked well with Mathlive. Since Mathlive's update it has worked really well. Although I did have to rewrite the code in some parts to make sure Mathlive was still compatible.

## Code used from outside libraries

-   [Mathlive for math input fields and math display candy](https://cortexjs.io/).
-   [php math parser](https://github.com/mossadal/math-parser).
-   [function plotter for javascript and typescript](http://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/)

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
